3 : What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

To improve your learning process, you can:

Utilize the Feynman Technique: Explain complex topics in simple terms to reinforce your understanding.

Engage in Active Recall: Test yourself on the material to enhance memory and understanding.

Practice Spaced Repetition: Review information at intervals to reinforce long-term retention.

Diversify Your Learning Methods: Combine reading, watching, and doing to cater to different learning styles.

Stay Organized: Use tools like notes, flashcards, or digital apps to keep track of what you've learned.
