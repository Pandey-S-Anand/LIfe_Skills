### What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?
- Sexual harassment happens when someone does things like:
  - Saying sexual things to another person without them wanting it.
  - Making rude or sexual jokes that make others feel bad.
  - Touching someone inappropriately or making them feel unsafe in a sexual way.

### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?
- I'd calmly tell the person it's wrong.
- I'd support the person who was hurt and suggest they tell someone in charge.
- I'd remember what happened and tell a boss, HR, or the right people to make sure it gets handled.

### Explains different scenarios enacted by actors.
- Actors can act out different situations like:
  - Unwanted advances: One actor acts as if they're flirting or touching someone who doesn't like it.
  - Inappropriate comments: Actors use bad words, dirty jokes, or comments that make others uncomfortable.
  - Power dynamics: In a scene, one actor acts like they're in charge and uses their power to make someone do something they don't want to, showing how authority can be misused at work or in social situations.

### How to handle cases of harassment?
- To deal with harassment:
  - Be there for the person who's hurt. Listen and show that you care.
  - Tell them to write down what happened and gather any proof.
  - Help them report the harassment to the right people, like HR or the police, so they can look into it and take action.

### How to behave appropriately?
- To behave well:
  - Be nice to people, no matter where they're from or what they believe.
  - Follow the rules in society and at work so you don't upset anyone.
  - Talk honestly but kindly, and listen to others to have good conversations.
