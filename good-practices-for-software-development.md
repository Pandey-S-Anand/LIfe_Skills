**Question 1:** Which point(s) were new to you?

Points that were new to me are:

- Do not miss calls. If you cannot talk immediately, receive the call and inform them you will call back in 5-10 minutes, and call them back. This is a much better alternative than letting it go down as a missed call.

- Always keep your phone on silent. Remove notifications from the home screen. Only keep notifications for work-related apps.

**Question 2:** Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- It will not always be possible for your team members to get on a call with you. Instead, you can send a Slack, WhatsApp message. But instead of bombarding them with many messages, you can write down all the questions you have and send it as a single message.
